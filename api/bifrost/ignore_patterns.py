"""Canonical gitignore-style skip patterns for workspace file collection.

Standalone (no ``src.*`` imports) so both the client-side CLI
(``bifrost.cli`` push/pull/sync/watch) and server-side code (Solution
``capture``) share ONE source of truth for "files that must never be
collected/serialized" — build output, caches, editor turds, and most
importantly secret files (``.env``).

Patterns are ``gitwildmatch`` (the syntax ``pathspec`` parses), so callers
build a matcher with ``pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines("gitwildmatch", lines)``.
