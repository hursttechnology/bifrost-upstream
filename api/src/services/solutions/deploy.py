"""
Solution deploy — full-replace reconcile scoped strictly to ``solution_id``.

Deploy is the single writer for a disconnected install (success-criteria §3.6):
it upserts everything in the bundle and deletes entities previously under THIS
``solution_id`` that are absent from the new bundle. The deletion sweep is
gated on ``WHERE solution_id == sid AND id NOT IN bundle_ids`` — so it can never
touch ``_repo/`` rows (``solution_id IS NULL``) or any other install (a
different ``solution_id``). Scope correctness is by construction, not by a
path-existence heuristic (the destructive global sweep that the viability study
flagged is deliberately NOT reused here).

Python (workflows, modules) installs **as source** to ``_solutions/{id}/`` via
SolutionStorage and is executed as source by the virtual importer (§3.6). Every
deployed entity inherits the install's scope — its ``organization_id`` is the
install's ``organization_id`` (org-scoped or NULL/global), with no per-entity
scope binding (criterion 8).

Sub-plan 1 wires workflows end-to-end (the load-bearing path proven by the
execution criteria). Apps/forms/agents/tables hang off the same reconcile shape
and are added in their sub-plans.

        manifest_id)`` and whose in-bundle cross-refs are translated through the
        same map. The caller's ``bundle`` is NEVER mutated.

        Returning a fresh bundle (rather than mutating in place) makes deploy
        idempotent for the caller's object: deploying the SAME SolutionBundle
        instance twice in one process must not double-remap (the 2nd pass would
        otherwise treat the 1st pass's uuid5 ids as fresh manifest ids and remap
        them AGAIN, scrambling the wiring and making reconcile delete the rows it
        just created — Codex #8 P2). Entity dicts are deep-copied so the input's
        nested structures are untouched too.

        Two-pass so a cross-ref can point at any entity regardless of order:
          1. Build ``id_map`` (manifest id → remapped id) across ALL entity
             types, stamping each copy's own ``id``.
          2. Rewrite cross-ref fields (form→workflow, agent→workflow/agent)
             through ``id_map``. Portable ``path::fn``/name refs and refs that
             point outside the bundle are left untouched — they resolve by path
             within the install's solution scope at runtime.

        Apps reference workflows/tables only by string (``useWorkflow("p::f")`` /
        ``useTable("name")``) in their SOURCE, never by id in metadata, so app
