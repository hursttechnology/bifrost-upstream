"""Regression: GET /api/solutions/{id}/export must rebuild the workspace zip
LIVE from the entities the solution currently owns.

The old endpoint served a stale S3-cached zip written at deploy/capture time.
The fix (Task 1) rebuilt the endpoint to call
``SolutionCaptureService.bundle_for()`` + ``build_workspace_zip()`` on every
request. Task 2 deleted ``SolutionExportStore`` entirely — no cache exists to
go stale.

This test verifies the live-rebuild path: deploy a solution with an app, then
immediately export and confirm the app appears in the zip (no warm-up needed,
no cache to bust).
