"""Round-trip path drivers + policies.

A ``RoundTripPath`` names ONE real serialization round trip (e.g. the ``_repo``
git-sync path) and carries: the per-field-class policy that path applies, the
row-pairing strategy, and thin async wrappers that drive the REAL export/import
code — NO reimplementation of any serialization logic.

CONFORMANCE FRAMING (post Slice 4 #390): each ``Manifest*`` model now owns its
own serialization (``from_row`` / ``view(dest)`` / ``to_orm_values(dest)``), and
the four legacy writer families (``manifest_generator.serialize_*``,
``capture._*_entries``, ``manifest_import._resolve_*``, ``deploy._upsert_*``)
delegate to it. So ``FIELD_OVERRIDES`` and ``EXTRA_FIELD_POLICY`` below are no
longer a babysitter for four hand-written writers that could each drift — they
are the CONFORMANCE SPEC for the ONE model in charge: the per-path divergences a
single source-of-truth must reproduce. A new entry here means the model's view /
partition genuinely differs on that path, not that one of four writers forgot a
field.

The ``_repo`` path drives:
  - export (DB -> ``.bifrost/*.yaml``): ``GitHubSyncService._regenerate_manifest_to_dir``
    (the split-file writer the importer reads — NOT bare ``generate_manifest``).
  - import (``.bifrost/*.yaml`` -> DB): ``GitHubSyncService._import_all_entities``
    (the wrapper that runs the Workflow/Form/Agent indexer side-effects).

``_import_all_entities`` is INCREMENTAL — ``_diff_and_collect`` returns early when
no entity id changed, so an export-then-import of the SAME DB state no-ops and
would false-green. The test driver forces a real delta by DELETING the seeded
entity between export and import, then asserts the import actually touched it
(``count > 0``) before checking the field round trip.
