"""Regression guard for the e2e test harness (docker-compose.test.yml).

Protects against re-introducing a class of bug where the `api` service — which
runs as **root** and whose entrypoint does ``chown -R bifrost:bifrost
/tmp/bifrost`` — bind-mounts the host LOG_DIR root over its ``/tmp/bifrost``.

When that happens the api container recursively chowns the **host** LOG_DIR
(and the files the harness writes there: ``test-runner.log``,
``test-results.xml``, the per-service ``*.log``) to uid 1000. On a CI runner
whose uid is NOT 1000, the host-side ``tee "$LOG_DIR/test-runner.log"`` in
``test.sh::run_pytest`` then fails with EPERM, which makes the e2e step exit 1
**even though every test passed** (`728 passed … ##[error] exit code 1`). It
hid from single-process local runs because a uid-1000 dev host is immune to the
chown (chowning to its own uid is a no-op).

The api may share ONLY the fixture subdir the install/preview-repo e2e tests
stage file:// git repos in; that subdir's files are created by the uid-1000
test-runner, so chowning them to 1000 is harmless and never touches LOG_DIR.
