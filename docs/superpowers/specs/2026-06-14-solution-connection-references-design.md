# Solution Connection References & the Unified Unmet-Needs Engine

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Status:** Design — approved shape, pending spec review
**Worktree/branch:** `solutions-success-criteria` / `desloppify/code-health` (rides the draft PR #347 stack)
**Predecessor:** `2026-06-14-solution-export-import-portability-design.md` (export/import DONE)

## Problem

A Bifrost **Solution** that uses integrations installs **"dead."** Today a solution
declares the **configs** it needs (`SolutionConfigSchema`) and surfaces unset ones in a
Setup checklist with `setup_complete`. But it has **no equivalent for integrations**:

1. **Connections aren't declared.** A workflow calls `integrations.get("HaloPSA")`, but
   nothing in the bundle records "this solution needs a HaloPSA integration." The admin
   installing it gets zero signal which integrations to set up.
2. **Integrations don't travel as templates.** Even when the admin knows they need
   "HaloPSA," they must build the integration (config schema, OAuth provider shape, data
   provider) from scratch. The portable, client-agnostic *skeleton* of the integration
   is exactly the kind of thing capture could carry.
3. **Other unmet needs fail silently at runtime.** Missing shared `modules/*.py` and
   missing cross-solution dependencies are computed by the dependency walker at *capture*
   time, but install/upgrade does **not** check them — a missing module surfaces only as a
   runtime `ModuleNotFoundError`, not a blocked or flagged install. Power Platform blocks
   on missing dependencies; we don't.
4. **No install-time setup guidance.** There's nowhere for a solution author to write
   "here's how to wire this up / here's the disaster-recovery procedure."

This is the #1 competitive gap vs Power Platform's connection references (per the
export/import arc's competitive review). The fix is **declare-and-surface**, NOT
port-tokens — Power Platform doesn't port credentials either, and neither should we.

## Goals

- **Declare** the integrations a solution's code references (auto-scanned at capture).
- **Template** the safe, portable skeleton of each referenced integration so install can
  pre-create an empty shell the admin just fills in.
- **Surface** unmet needs (unset required configs + missing integrations) through a guided
  **Setup wizard** (stepped configs → connections, creating integration templates inline and
  warning when OAuth still needs connecting), launched by a solution-level "Setup Required"
  warning triangle that accurately reflects `setup_complete`.
- **Block** at install/upgrade on missing modules / cross-solution deps (the silent-runtime
  fix) — the one class of unmet need the admin *can't* self-resolve post-install.
- **Document** — a markdown README, sourced from the solution repo, rendered as the first
  tab.
- **Unify** all of the above into one "what does this solution need that isn't satisfied
  here" engine, overhauling the existing dependency walker rather than bolting on a parallel
  path.

## Non-Goals

- **Do NOT port OAuth tokens, client IDs, or client secrets.** Those are client-specific
  and travel with nobody (same rule as the secrets scrub in the export bundle).
- **Do NOT require a *connected* token for a connection to count as "satisfied."** Not all
  integrations use OAuth; existence of the global integration is the bar (see below).
- **Do NOT clobber an existing integration** on install. If a global `Integration` named X
  already exists, leave it entirely alone — never overwrite a working production config.
- No PP-style layering / managed-vs-unmanaged. (Deliberate prior decision — hard-409 on
  collision is correct.)
- No additive "Update" mode or promotion pipeline (separate future arcs).

## Key domain facts (verified in code)

- **Integrations are global.** `Integration.name` is globally unique; there is **no per-org
  Integration**. So "does integration X exist" is a **global** existence check, never
  org-scoped.
- **Bindings are org-scoped.** An `IntegrationMapping` (carrying `oauth_token_id`) can be
  org-specific or global/default. *Connectedness* lives here — but it's informational only
  (see below).
- **Workflows reference integrations by name string.** `integrations.get("HaloPSA")` — a
  string literal, statically scannable exactly like `tables.get("x")` / `config.get("k")`.
  This is what makes auto-scan-at-capture viable.
- **`Solution.setup_complete` already exists** as a column — the engine extends what feeds
  it; no migration for that field.
- **OAuthProvider safe vs secret fields are cleanly separable:** safe = `provider_name`,
  `display_name`, `oauth_flow_type`, `authorization_url`, `token_url`, `audience`,
  `token_url_defaults`, `entity_id_source`, `scopes`, `redirect_uri`; **secret/scrubbed** =
  `client_id`, `encrypted_client_secret`, `organization_id`, `status*`, tokens.

## Design

### 1. The unified requirement model

Every solution has **requirements** that may or may not be **satisfied** in the
install environment. Four kinds, computed by one engine, surfaced uniformly:

| Kind | Declared from | "Satisfied" means | Unmet → |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| `config` | `SolutionConfigSchema` (today) | a `Config` row with that key exists in install org scope | inline value input (today) |
| `connection` | **NEW** auto-scanned `integrations.get("X")` refs | a **global** `Integration` named X exists | "Set up integration" action → opens integration page (pre-created shell) |
| `module` | scanned `modules/*` import closure (walker) | the module file is present in the installed repo | **blocks install/upgrade** (informational in checklist) |
| `solution_dep` | cross-solution refs (walker) | the referenced solution is installed in scope | **blocks install/upgrade** (informational in checklist) |

**Connection "satisfied" = global Integration named X exists. Nothing more.** Not all
integrations use OAuth, so requiring a connected token would produce false "unmet"
warnings. Existence is the honest bar.

**Connectedness is a secondary informational icon, never a gate.** If we *can* tell an
integration has a resolving mapping/token, show a small confirmation icon (e.g. a plug /
secondary check) so the admin doesn't have to open the OAuth tab to verify. Its absence
does **not** mean "unmet" and does **not** imply the connection is required — it's a
convenience only.

`setup_complete` = all *required* `config` items satisfied **AND** all `connection` items
satisfied. `module` / `solution_dep` gaps do not feed `setup_complete` (they block earlier,
at install).

### 2. Connection declaration (auto-scan at capture)

Add `scan_integration_refs(source) -> set[str]` to `ref_scanner.py` — a regex matching
`integrations.get("NAME")` / `sdk.integrations.get("NAME")` (first arg = integration name),
mirroring `scan_config_refs`. The dependency walker already drains a per-workflow scan loop
(`while wf_worklist - scanned_wf`); add an integration sweep there, collecting referenced
integration names. Computed/dynamic refs stay invisible — same documented static-scan
tradeoff as configs/tables (the human-checked preview is the backstop).

At capture, for each referenced integration name that resolves to a global `Integration`
row, build a **`SolutionConnectionSchema`** declaration + a portable **integration
template** (§3). Store on the solution like config declarations:

- **New ORM:** `SolutionConnectionSchema` (`solution_id`, `integration_name`,
  `position`, plus the template JSON — see §3). Mirrors `SolutionConfigSchema`.
- **New `capture.py` step** `_connection_entries(...)` analogous to `_config_entries`,
  populating the bundle's new `connection_declarations` list.

### 3. Integration template (safe skeleton)

For each declared connection, capture serializes a **client-agnostic skeleton** so install
can pre-create an empty integration to fill in:

**Carried (safe):**
- Integration: `name`, `entity_id_name`, `default_entity_id`, data-provider attachment
  (`list_entities_data_provider_id` — remapped/resolved by name on install if the provider
  workflow travels in the same bundle; otherwise left null with a note).
- Integration config schema: the full `IntegrationConfigSchema` list (key/type/required/
  description/options/position) — the "fields to fill out."
- OAuth provider shape (if present): `provider_name`, `display_name`, `oauth_flow_type`,
  `authorization_url`, `token_url`, `audience`, `token_url_defaults`, `entity_id_source`,
  `scopes`, `redirect_uri`.

**Scrubbed (client-specific / secret):**
- `client_id`, `encrypted_client_secret`, any `oauth_token`/mapping rows,
  `organization_id`, `status`/`status_message`/`last_token_refresh`, `entity_id` values
  from mappings.

Scrub rules live in `portable.py` (new integration-scrub section, mirroring existing entity
scrubs). A round-trip test asserts no secret field survives serialization.

**On install/deploy** (`deploy.py` new `_upsert_integration_shells`):
- If a global `Integration` named X **does not exist** → create the empty shell: the
  Integration row + its `IntegrationConfigSchema` rows + an `OAuthProvider` skeleton
  (with `client_id=""`, `encrypted_client_secret=b""`, `status="not_connected"`). The admin
  lands on a pre-built integration with empty credential fields.
- If it **already exists** → no-op. Never touch a working integration.
- Track created shells in the deploy result for the install summary.

### 4. Install-time dependency blocking (the silent-runtime fix)

Overhaul the dependency walker into the engine that also runs at **install/upgrade preview**
(not just capture). Add a `check_install(bundle, target_scope) -> UnmetNeeds` path that, for
the entities about to be installed, verifies:

- **modules:** every `modules/*.py` import in the bundle's workflows resolves to a file
  present in the bundle (or already installed in the target repo).
- **solution_dep:** every cross-solution `path::fn` / entity ref resolves to a solution
  already installed in the target scope (or included in this bundle).

A missing module or unresolved cross-solution dep **blocks install/upgrade** with a clear
error naming what's missing (mirrors `RequiredConfigUnset`'s "names the key" ergonomic).
This is wired into the existing install preview + the `zip_install` / `deploy` entrypoints.
Connections and configs do **not** block (they're set-up-after-install needs); modules and
deps do (they're unresolvable post-install).

### 5. Solution README (markdown, first tab)

- **New column** `Solution.readme: Text | None` (one migration; alongside it,
  `SolutionConnectionSchema`'s table).
- **Source of truth:** `README.md` in the solution repo root. Pulled into `Solution.readme`
  on deploy (CLI `solution deploy` + git sync), travels in the export bundle, and editing
  in-app writes back to the repo file on next sync (same round-trip discipline as
  code/schema).
- **Render:** first tab of the solution detail page, via the existing TipTap editor
  (read + edit). Markdown.
- If no README present, the tab shows an empty-state / "add setup instructions" prompt.

### 6. Surfacing — the guided Setup wizard + warning triangle

Setup is a **launched, stepped wizard**, not a passive tab. The solution-level
**"Setup Required" yellow triangle** (shown on the detail header / list row whenever
`setup_complete` is false) carries a **"Continue Setup"** action that opens the wizard.
This collapses the previously-separate Setup checklist tab into the wizard — the
`SolutionSetupChecklist` component becomes the wizard's step bodies. (The README remains its
own separate first tab — reference doc, not part of the wizard.)

Extend `setup_status.py` → the unified engine produces a `SolutionSetupStatus` whose
`items` carry a `kind` discriminator (`config` | `connection`), plus per-connection
template metadata (`has_oauth`, `integration_exists`, `connected`). The wizard renders two
steps:

- **Step 1 — Configs:** declared configs with inline value editing (the existing
  `ConfigItem` body: yellow border when required+unset, value input, Set action). A live
  "all required configs satisfied" indicator gates advancing-without-warning.
- **Step 2 — Connections:** declared integrations. For each:
  - On entering the step, the **template/shell has already been created at install** (§3);
    the wizard shows the integration with a "Set up integration" deep-link (opens the
    existing integration settings page in a new tab — matches "open a tab, set it up, come
    back to a checkmark").
  - Shows whether the integration's **required integration-config** is filled.
  - If the template carried an **OAuth provider shape**, shows a **warning**: "this
    integration uses OAuth — connect it (client ID/secret + authorize) in Integrations."
    This is **warn-only**: an unconnected OAuth does **NOT** keep the triangle red.
  - Informational **connectedness icon** when a token resolves (convenience confirmation).

**Triangle / `setup_complete` accuracy:** `setup_complete` = all *required* configs
satisfied **AND** all declared integrations **exist** (shells get created on install, so
this is usually true immediately — the triangle then reflects "required configs unfilled").
OAuth connection status is **warn-only** and never feeds `setup_complete`; the wizard makes
the warning visible so the admin isn't surprised, but existence remains the bar. Because the
wizard walks both configs and connections and creates templates inline, the triangle becomes
an accurate "you've been through setup and everything *required* is satisfied" signal rather
than a naive "a config row is missing."

`module` / `solution_dep` needs never appear in the wizard (they blocked at install); a
legacy install surfacing one renders it as a read-only warning row.

## Data flow

```
CAPTURE (capture.py + walker)
  scan workflow source → integration name refs
    → SolutionConnectionSchema rows + integration templates (scrubbed via portable.py)
  bundle.connection_declarations = [...]
  bundle.integration_templates   = [...]   (safe skeletons)
  bundle.readme                  = README.md from repo root

EXPORT → zip (unchanged transport; new bundle fields ride along)

INSTALL / DEPLOY (deploy.py + zip_install.py)
  check_install(bundle, scope):
    modules / solution_dep unmet → BLOCK (clear error)
  _upsert_integration_shells: create empty integration if absent, else no-op
  write Solution.readme
  recompute setup_complete (config + connection)

VIEW (solutions router + client)
  GET /solutions/{id}/setup → unified SolutionSetupStatus (config + connection items)
  README tab (TipTap) ← Solution.readme
  "Setup Required" triangle ← setup_complete; "Continue Setup" launches the wizard
    (Step 1 configs → Step 2 connections; OAuth warn-only)
  RUNTIME backstop: integrations.get("X") on a missing integration → loud
    RequiredConnectionUnset (mirrors RequiredConfigUnset), naming the integration.
```

## Components & boundaries

| Unit | Responsibility | Depends on |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| `ref_scanner.scan_integration_refs` | static scan of `integrations.get("X")` | regex only |
| `dependency_walker` (overhauled) | capture preview **+** `check_install` unmet-needs | scanners, DB, repo |
| `SolutionConnectionSchema` (ORM) | persisted connection declarations + template | — |
| `portable.py` integration scrub | strip secrets from integration template | — |
| `capture._connection_entries` | build connection declarations + templates | walker, DB |
| `deploy._upsert_integration_shells` | create empty integration if absent | DB |
| `deploy` / `zip_install` install-block | enforce module/dep unmet → error | walker.check_install |
| `setup_status` (unified) | config + connection → `SolutionSetupStatus` (kind + template meta) | DB |
| `Solution.readme` + sync | README round-trip repo ↔ DB | git_sync, deploy |
| Setup wizard (client) | stepped configs → connections; warns on OAuth; launched by triangle | `SolutionSetupChecklist` bodies |
| README tab (client) | TipTap render/edit of `Solution.readme` (separate first tab) | existing editor |
| `RequiredConnectionUnset` (SDK/runtime) | loud error on missing integration | — |

## Error handling

- **Missing integration at runtime:** `integrations.get("X")` for a solution-declared,
  nonexistent integration raises `RequiredConnectionUnset(name, "set it up in Integrations")`
  — parallel to `RequiredConfigUnset`. (Non-declared `integrations.get` keeps returning
  `None` as today — we only escalate declared ones.) **Declared-ness is known at runtime
  because the SDK call carries the executing solution's id** (the same `ctx.solution_id`
  the table/config resolver already uses — see the F2 fix in
  `project_solutions_implementation`); the integrations endpoint checks whether the named
  integration is declared by that solution's `SolutionConnectionSchema` before deciding to
  return `None` vs raise. A bare/loose (non-solution) call path is unaffected.
- **Missing module / cross-solution dep at install:** hard error from `check_install`,
  naming the missing item; nothing lands (pre-deploy check).
- **Integration shell creation collision:** existing integration → silent no-op (never
  clobber).
- **Data provider in template references a provider not in the bundle:** create the shell
  with a null data-provider + a note; don't fail the install.
- **README absent:** empty-state tab; never an error.

## Testing

- **Unit:** `scan_integration_refs` (incl. `sdk.` prefix, ignores dynamic refs);
  portable integration scrub (no secret survives — assert on every secret field);
  `check_install` blocks on missing module/dep and passes when present; unified
  `setup_status` mixes config + connection items + computes `setup_complete` correctly;
  `_upsert_integration_shells` creates-if-absent / no-op-if-present.
- **E2E:** capture a solution whose workflow calls `integrations.get("X")` → export →
  install into a fresh org → assert (a) an empty Integration X shell was created with its
  config schema + OAuth skeleton and no secrets, (b) `setup_complete` is false with a
  connection item unmet, (c) install of a bundle with a missing module is **blocked**,
  (d) README round-trips repo → DB → tab.
- **Client vitest:** the Setup wizard renders the configs step (inline edit) then the
  connections step ("Set up integration" deep-link, connectedness icon, **OAuth warn-only**
  message when `has_oauth` and not connected — and assert it does NOT block/gate
  completion); the "Setup Required" triangle + "Continue Setup" launch shows when
  `setup_complete` is false and hides when true.
- **Contract/DTO parity + contract-version tripwire** after touching contracts/DTOs.

## Migration

One Alembic migration: `solution_connection_schema` table + `solutions.readme` column.
`setup_complete` column already exists.

## Open questions / deferred

- **README write-back conflict semantics** (in-app edit vs repo edit) follow the same
  last-sync-wins discipline as other code round-trips; no new conflict UI this arc.
- Per-integration **version/compat** of the template skeleton is out of scope (templates are
  best-effort skeletons, not versioned contracts).
- Data-provider-by-name resolution across bundles is best-effort (null + note when absent).
