# Solution Workspace (v2) — Reference

A Solution is an installable, deployable unit. Every entity it owns — apps, workflows, forms, agents, tables, configs — is **deploy-owned**: the platform writes them at install/deploy time and treats them as read-only afterwards. Declared file locations are also part of the Solution definition; their runtime file bytes are user data. Live entity mutation (the entity create/update CLI verbs) returns a 409 because deploy owns those records. You author content in the workspace and ship it with `bifrost solution deploy` (full replace).

> **For a full worked path (including v1→v2 migration and first-time setup), use the `bifrost:migrate` skill.**

## Lifecycle

### 1. Scaffold the workspace

```bash
bifrost solution init . --slug my-solution --name "My Solution"
```

Creates `bifrost.solution.yaml` in the current directory. The hub uses this file as the mode marker — its presence switches all subsequent commands to solution mode.

### 2. Scaffold a v2 app

```bash
bifrost solution scaffold-app my-app
```

Scaffolds a `standalone_v2` React app under `apps/my-app/`. Config files sit at the app root (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `components.json`, `index.html`); **source files live under `apps/my-app/src/`** (`main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `index.css`, `lib/utils.ts`). The `bifrost` SDK is resolved from the running instance (not npm), so no `npm install bifrost` is needed.

> The scaffold wires up Tailwind (`@tailwindcss/vite` + shadcn theme tokens in `src/index.css`) but the generated `App.tsx` uses minimal **inline styles** (`style={{ padding: 24 }}`) as a plain starting point. Replace them with Tailwind classes (`className="p-6 ..."`) before building — the infrastructure is ready. See `references/apps.md` for v2 styling patterns.

To migrate a v1 inline app to standalone_v2, use `bifrost solution migrate-app <source-slug> <v2-slug>` — it ports source + rewrites imports + prints a judgment checklist.

### 3. Write workflows in `functions/`

Python workflows live in `functions/` (e.g. `functions/hello.py`). Reference them by portable `path::function` strings, never by UUID or bare name:

```python
# functions/hello.py
from bifrost import workflow

@workflow
async def main():
    return {"greeting": "hello"}
```

A workflow takes its inputs as **parameters** (e.g. `async def add_task(title: str, priority: str = "low")`) — there is **no `ctx` parameter**. The SDK is reached through top-level module imports, not a context object: `from bifrost import tables` then `tables.query(...)` / `tables.insert(...)` (see `references/python-sdk.md` and `references/workflows-python.md`). Prefer `async def`.

In a form, agent, or app, reference this as `functions/hello.py::main`. The platform resolves the portable ref at deploy time.

> **A new workflow needs a `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` entry — deploy creates the row from the manifest, not by scanning `functions/`.** Deploy bundles *all* `functions/*.py` source into the install, but it creates a workflow **row** only for functions listed in `.bifrost/workflows.yaml`. The scaffold writes the sample's entry for you (`functions/hello.py::main`), so the sample works on first deploy. For a workflow you add *yourself*, add an entry then deploy — that's the whole flow (no `register`, no `push`, no capture):
>
> 1. Write `functions/tasks.py` (e.g. a `@workflow def my_task(): ...`).
> 2. Add an entry to `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` under `workflows:` — keyed by a fresh UUID, with `id` (same UUID), `name`, `path`, `function_name`. This is the SAME thing the scaffold does for its sample; mirror that block:
>    ```yaml
>    workflows:
>      <fresh-uuid>:
>        id: <fresh-uuid>
>        name: my_task
>        path: functions/tasks.py
>        function_name: my_task
>    ```
> 3. `bifrost solution deploy` → the row is created from the manifest entry and the source ships in the install bundle. Verified: a hand-added entry + deploy reports the extra workflow upserted and it executes.
>
> This is the one place you DO add a `.bifrost/` entry by hand — adding a NEW workflow row is exactly what the scaffold does programmatically, and there is no CLI command for it. (The "don't hand-edit `.bifrost/`" guidance is about not corrupting an EXISTING managed entity's identity/UUID, not about adding a new workflow.) The UUID you write is provisional — a later `bifrost solution pull` rewrites `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` with the server's canonical UUID, which is expected; don't be surprised when your hand-typed id changes. The capture→pull→deploy road below is for adopting a workflow that already exists as a loose `_repo/` entity — overkill for one you're authoring fresh in the solution.

### 4. Local dev

```bash
bifrost solution start
```

Runs the app's Vite dev server and local workflow functions behind one origin — no deploy required. Hot reload works for both app code and workflow code. The org-targeting flags (below) run under a specific org context (superuser only); omit them to run under your own org.

Open the origin the command prints (the **proxy** port; `--port` sets it, default 3000). Vite itself binds to **`--port + 1`** behind the proxy — drive the app at the proxy port the command prints, not the Vite port.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
bifrost solution deploy                       # your own org (home)
bifrost solution deploy --global              # the global install
bifrost solution deploy --org "Target Org"    # a specific org
```

Full-replace deploy of the workspace — all entities are written (or overwritten) from the workspace content. Org targeting follows the **unified `--org` standard** (see below).

### 5a. Declare Solution file locations

If the Solution needs durable runtime files, declare named locations in `.bifrost/files.yaml`:

```yaml
locations:
  - finance
  - documents
```

These names become policy-addressable file locations for the install. They are the portable declaration, not the file content itself. Rules:

- Use business/domain names (`finance`, `documents`, `attachments`), not platform internals.
- Do not declare `workspace`; it is reserved.
- Do not create or manage `_solutions/` or `_solution_artifacts/` folders yourself. Those are internal storage prefixes for deployed source and export artifacts.
- Runtime files are read and written through the Files SDK (`files`, `useFiles`) or the Files CLI/API with `--solution <install-id-or-slug>`. They are not source files under `apps/` or `functions/`.

### 6. Install from a zip

```bash
bifrost solution install my-solution.zip                     # your own org (home)
bifrost solution install my-solution.zip --global            # global install
bifrost solution install my-solution.zip --org "Target Org"  # a specific org
```

Installs a packaged solution (drag-and-drop equivalent). Use `--set KEY=VALUE` to supply config values at install time. Full-backup zips created with encrypted backup content require `--password`, and `--replace-secrets` / `--replace-data` control whether existing install data is overwritten. **`install` with no org flag installs into your own org** (not global) — pass `--global` for a global install.

### 7. Export and backup

```bash
bifrost solution export <solution-ref> --mode shareable
bifrost solution export <solution-ref> --mode full --password "$PASSWORD" --include-data
```

Export modes:

- **Shareable** exports carry code, manifests, schema, declared file locations, and setup requirements. They do not carry secrets, table rows, or runtime file bytes.
- **Full** exports are backups. With `--password`, they can carry secret/config values; with `--include-data`, they also carry table rows and solution runtime files in the encrypted tier.
- File payloads in a full backup are encrypted payload members referenced from `.bifrost/secrets.enc`; do not expect plaintext runtime files as ordinary zip members.

### The unified `--org` standard

Every org-targeting **write** command (`create`/`update`/`set`/`register`, and the `solution` subcommands) takes the same flag:

- **Omit it** → your own org ("home"). A bare command never writes a global entity by accident.
- **`--org <uuid|name>`** → that org.
- **`--global`** (or `--org none` / `--org global`) → global scope (organization_id NULL).
- **`--organization` and `--scope`** are permanent synonyms for `--org`.

This applies to the `solution` subcommands (`deploy`, `pull`, `start`, `install`) and to the write verbs of the `_repo`-workspace entity commands (`tables`, `forms`, `agents`, `configs`, `claims`, `workflows`, `events`). **Read commands (`list`/`get`) do NOT take `--org`/`--global`** — they return the caller's full combined visibility. Install **kind** (org vs global) is purely this deploy-time choice — it is **not** stored in the descriptor; the server derives it from `organization_id` (NULL == global).

---

## One definition, many installs

`bifrost.solution.yaml` is the **definition** descriptor — `slug`, `name`, `version`, `global_repo_access`, and git-source fields (`git_connected`, `git_repo_url`, `repo_subpath`, `git_ref`, `logo`). It is **stateless** and intentionally carries **no install id** and **no install scope** — install kind (org vs global) is the installer's deploy-time `--org`/`--global` choice, not a descriptor field. It also doubles as the workspace mode marker (its presence is what switches tooling into solution mode).

The install id lives **server-side** (`Solution.id` — the `solution_id` stamped on every managed entity *at deploy time*). **Nothing in the repo carries install identity** — not the descriptor, not `.bifrost/*.yaml` (its entries deliberately omit org/access/identity for portability). The repo is the **definition**; deploy is what mints an install and stamps identity onto the entity rows it writes. Deploy/pull resolve *which install* at runtime by matching **`(slug, org)`** against the server's installs, creating one if none matches.

**Instance vs fork — the `slug` is the dividing line:**

- **One definition, many installs (instances).** Keep **one repo / one slug** and deploy it per customer-org: `bifrost solution deploy --org "Customer Org"` (or `bifrost solution install pkg.zip --org "Customer Org"`). Each org gets an **independent install** — its own id, config values, and entity rows — from the *same* source. Deploy refuses to let one org clobber another org's install of the same slug. This is how you run "the same HR portal" for 3 customers: one codebase, three installs.
- **A genuinely different solution → fork (new slug).** If a customer needs the solution to *diverge* (different features/code, not just different data), **fork the repo and give it a new `slug`**. Different slug = different definition = a separate solution, not an instance of the first. There is no per-customer stamping in the repo to do this for you — forking is the mechanism.
- **Multiple repos / subfolders** for git-connected installs are distinguished by `repo_subpath` (omni-repo: one repo, a folder per solution) and `git_ref` (pin a branch/tag).
- **Natural key collision** (two installs of the same slug in the same org) → resolution raises an ambiguity error; pass **`--solution <install-id>`** to target one install by id.

Install **kind** is chosen entirely at deploy/install time via the unified `--org`/`--global` standard — there is no `scope` in the descriptor. `--global` makes a global install (organization_id NULL); `--org "Customer Org"` makes an org install; omitting both installs into your own org. The server derives the install's scope from `organization_id` (NULL == global), so the same descriptor deploys global OR per-org from the same source.

## Getting forms, agents, tables, configs, and files into a Solution

A solution owns these entities the same way it owns apps and workflows: deploy writes them, and they are read-only afterwards. File location declarations are also deploy-owned. There are two ways entity content arrives in the workspace manifest deploy reads.

**Path A — capture an existing entity (the migration road).** This adopts a loose `_repo`/global entity that already exists OUTSIDE the solution (authored earlier in the `_repo` workspace, where live entity create/update is the normal path — see `references/repo.md`). Capture stamps it into the install, then you pull and deploy:

```bash
bifrost solution capture <solution-id> --table <id> --form <id> --agent <id> --config <KEY>
bifrost solution pull --org "Target Org"     # bring captured entities into source .bifrost/
bifrost solution deploy --org "Target Org"   # ship them
```

(Use the same org target — `--org "Target Org"`, `--global`, or omit for your own org — on `pull` and `deploy` that you used to create the install.)

The capture flags are singular and repeatable: `--table`, `--form`, `--agent`, `--config`, `--claim`, `--workflow`, `--app` (each takes a name or id; `--config` takes a key).

> **Ordering for a form/agent that references a workflow:** a form's `workflow_id` (and an agent's tool refs) must resolve to a **registered** workflow UUID — i.e. a workflow that has a row. The scaffold's sample (`functions/hello.py::main`) ships with a `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` entry, so it's registered on the **first `bifrost solution deploy`**. A workflow you write yourself is registered the same way: add its `.bifrost/workflows.yaml` entry (see "Write workflows in `functions/`" above), then `bifrost solution deploy` creates the row. So for a fresh solution the order is: write the workflow → add its manifest entry → **`solution deploy`** (creates the workflow row) → create the form/agent referencing that workflow → capture the form/agent (`--form`/`--agent`) → pull → deploy. (Reference the workflow by portable `path::function` ref; a bare name like `hello` can collide, so prefer the full `functions/hello.py::main` ref or the UUID.)

**Which org target to use on `pull`/`deploy`.** `pull` and `deploy` resolve *which install* by `(slug, org)`, where the org comes from the unified `--org` standard (omit = your own org; `--org <uuid|name>` = that org; `--global` = the global install). So:

- **Global install** (created with `--global`) → pass `--global` on `pull`/`deploy`.
- **Install in your own org** → omit the flag; resolution is unambiguous.
- **Install in a *different* org** (created with `--org "Target Org"`) → pass the **same `--org "Target Org"`** to `pull` and `deploy`. Resolution only looks in the targeted org, so without it `pull`/`deploy` won't find that install (and may resolve a stale same-slug install in your own org instead) — a deploy can keep 409-blocking even after you "pulled".

The rule: pick the org target once (commonly when first deploying a fresh install into a customer's org) and use the **same** target for that install's `pull`/`deploy`. To skip org resolution entirely, pass **`--solution <install-id>`** to target an install by id.

**Scope and capture — the loose entity must already be in the install's scope.** `bifrost solution capture` only adopts loose entities **already in the install's own scope**: an org install captures that org's entities; a global install captures global (`organization_id: null`) entities. The CLI resolves your `--table/--form/...` selectors against the install's **candidate list** (`/capture/candidates`) and refuses anything outside its scope — including by id — with "not in /capture/candidates for its scope". A concrete org-A entity is likewise never capturable into an org-B install (cross-tenant).

So if the loose entity is in a different scope, **it must be authored in the install's scope first** — which happens in the `_repo` workspace, not here (see `references/repo.md`). There, the unified `--org` standard sets the entity's scope: an org install needs an entity created in that org (`--org <uuid|name>`), and a global install needs a global entity (`--global`). Don't rely on capture to fix scope for you; set it up front.

(The server-side capture service has a latent global→org re-stamp path, but the CLI's candidate gate makes it unreachable today.)

Capture stamps ownership server-side but does **not** write source. `bifrost solution pull` materializes the captured entities into the workspace `.bifrost/*.yaml` manifest (it touches only `.bifrost/`, never your `apps/` or `functions/` source — safe to run any time). Then deploy ships them.

**The deploy guard:** because deploy is full-replace, an entity captured in the UI/CLI but absent from your source manifest would be deleted by the reconcile sweep. To prevent silent loss, **deploy 409-blocks** if a captured-but-unpulled entity is missing from the manifest, naming it and telling you to `bifrost solution pull` first. An entity you previously pulled and then deliberately removed from the manifest is a genuine delete and proceeds. So the rule is simple: **after any capture, run `bifrost solution pull` before `bifrost solution deploy`.**

**Path B — author from scratch.** The `bifrost:migrate` skill scaffolds a complete solution (including its forms/agents/tables) end-to-end; invoke it as a Claude skill (not a CLI command) when starting fresh.

**Files are different from captured entities.** Add file *locations* to `.bifrost/files.yaml`; do not capture individual files into the source manifest. Runtime files are written later by the installed app or workflows. A full backup can carry those file bytes, but normal deploy is intentionally non-destructive for files absent from the bundle.

### Updating an already-owned entity

Once an entity is solution-managed, the live entity update verbs **409** (deploy owns it). The update path is to **edit its field in the corresponding `.bifrost/*.yaml` and redeploy**:

```bash
# e.g. change an agent's prompt:
$EDITOR .bifrost/agents.yaml      # edit the system_prompt under that agent's UUID
bifrost solution deploy           # redeploys the changed content
```

This is the intended, correct update surface — `.bifrost/*.yaml` is generated by `capture` + `pull` on first adoption, but **its content fields are yours to edit thereafter**. The one thing you must NOT do by hand is add or remove entity **UUID keys** (that changes entity identity and trips the deploy guard / reconcile sweep) — use `capture` + `pull` to introduce a new entity, and a manifest-omission deploy to delete one you previously pulled.

What is settled:
- Live entity create/update commands against a solution-managed record **409** — deploy owns those records; edit `.bifrost/*.yaml` + redeploy instead.
- `.bifrost/*.yaml` is generated by `capture` + `pull` on first adoption; after that, edit entity **content fields** there to update them. Do not hand-add/remove entity **UUID keys** — capture/pull introduces entities, manifest-omission deletes them.

## The v2 SDK surface

Apps built with `bifrost solution scaffold-app` consume the v2 `bifrost` SDK. Key exports:

| Export | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `BifrostProvider` | Root provider — wrap your app |
| `useBifrostContext` | Auth, org, user from context |
| `BifrostHeader` | Pre-built nav header |
| `useWorkflow` / `useWorkflowQuery` / `useWorkflowMutation` | Execute workflows; query-style for data loads, mutation-style for actions |
| `useTable` / `useInfiniteTable` | Direct table read with live updates |
| `tables` | Low-level CRUD (`tables.get`, `tables.insert`, `tables.update`, `tables.delete`) + error classes |
| `useFiles` | Live file listing for a location/prefix |
| `files` | Low-level file API (`read`, `write`, `delete`, `list`, `exists`, signed URLs) + error classes |

There is no React, shadcn, or router injection from the SDK — import those from the standard packages. See `references/web-sdk-v2.md` for full signatures and examples.

## Key constraints

- Workflows must use portable `path::function` refs (e.g. `functions/hello.py::main`), not UUIDs or bare names — UUIDs are environment-specific and break portability.
- Solution file locations live in `.bifrost/files.yaml`; runtime file bytes are user data and only travel in encrypted full backups.
- `_solutions/` and `_solution_artifacts/` are platform internals. Never create those folders in a Solution workspace.
- The `bifrost:migrate` skill covers the v1→v2 migration path (slug swap, import rewrite, entity capture, etc.).
- For table schema and query patterns, see `references/tables.md`. For workflow authoring, see `references/workflows-python.md`.
